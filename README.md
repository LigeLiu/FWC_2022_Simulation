# 2022 FIFA World Cup Simulation
This project served as the final project for the course BAMS 503 Simulation Modeling I: Data Processing and Monte Carlo Simulation at Sauder School of Business at UBC.

In this project, we utilized several statistical theories including Monte Carlo Simulation to build a model predicting the results of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

## Introduction
The 2022 FIFA World Cup is scheduled to be the 22nd running of the FIFA World Cup competition, the quadrennial international men’s association football (commonly known as soccer in North America) championship contested by the national teams of the member associations of FIFA, the international governing body of the sport of soccer. In 2022, 32 teams will compete in Qatar and play in a total of 64 matches for the final championship.

As the most prestigious soccer tournament and one of the most followed sporting events in the world, the game results are highly anticipated. In this project, we built a simulation model in an attempt to predict the result of the championship, including the champion, the runner-up, and the teams entering the elimination rounds. We utilized concepts of Monte Carlo Simulation in BAMS 503 and previous research in modeling soccer match (Maher, 1982) outcomes to predict the outcome of each of the 64 matches.
